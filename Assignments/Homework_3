Questions
1) What does Python print for each of the following:
	johns_bag = Bag()
	johns_bag.print_bag()
	# what prints?

	for color in [’blue’, ’red’, ’green’, ’red’]:
	    johns_bag.add_skittle(Skittle(color))
	johns_bag.print_bag()
	# what prints?

	s = johns_bag.take_skittle()
	print(s.color)
	# what prints?

	print(johns_bag.number_sold)
	# what prints?

	print(Bag.number_sold)
	# what prints?

	soumyas_bag = Bag()
	soumyas_bag.print_bag()

	print(johns_bag.print_bag())
	# what prints?

	print(Bag.number_sold)
	# what prints?

	print(soumyas_bag.number_sold)
	# what prints?
	
	Answer 1
	>>[]
	  ['blue', 'red', 'green', 'red']
	  blue
	  1
	  1
	  []
	  ['red', 'green', 'red']
	  None
	  2
	  2
	
	2) Write a new method for the Bag class called take color, which takes a color and removes (and returns) a Skittle of that color from the bag. If there is no Skittle of that color, then it returns None.
	def take_color(self, color):

	Answer 2
	>>def take_color(self, color):
	  	if color in self.skittles
			skit=self.skittles,index(color)
			return self.skitles.pop(skit)
		else
			return none
	
	3. Write a new method for the Bag class called take all, which takes all the Skittles in the current bag and prints the color of the each Skittle taken from the bag.
	def take_all(self):

	Answer 3
	>>def take_all(self):
		eat= self.skittles._len_()
		num=0
		for num < eat
			return self.skittles.pop()
			num+=1
